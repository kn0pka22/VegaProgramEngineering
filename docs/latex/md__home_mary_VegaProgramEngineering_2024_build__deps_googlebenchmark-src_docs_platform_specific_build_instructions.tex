When the library is built using G\+CC it is necessary to link with the pthread library due to how G\+CC implements {\ttfamily std\+::thread}. Failing to link to pthread will lead to runtime exceptions (unless you\textquotesingle{}re using libc++), not linker errors. See \href{https://github.com/google/benchmark/issues/67}{\texttt{ issue \#67}} for more details. You can link to pthread by adding {\ttfamily -\/pthread} to your linker command. Note, you can also use {\ttfamily -\/lpthread}, but there are potential issues with ordering of command line parameters if you use that.

On Q\+NX, the pthread library is part of libc and usually included automatically (see \href{https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/index.html\#com.qnx.doc.neutrino.lib_ref/topic/p/pthread_create.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily pthread\+\_\+create()}}}). There\textquotesingle{}s no separate pthread library to link.\hypertarget{md__home_mary_VegaProgramEngineering_2024_build__deps_googlebenchmark-src_docs_platform_specific_build_instructions_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{Building with Visual Studio 2015 or 2017}\label{md__home_mary_VegaProgramEngineering_2024_build__deps_googlebenchmark-src_docs_platform_specific_build_instructions_autotoc_md17}
The {\ttfamily shlwapi} library ({\ttfamily -\/lshlwapi}) is required to support a call to {\ttfamily C\+P\+U\+Info} which reads the registry. Either add {\ttfamily shlwapi.\+lib} under {\ttfamily \mbox{[} Configuration Properties $>$ Linker $>$ Input \mbox{]}}, or use the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Alternatively, can add libraries using linker options.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#ifdef \_WIN32}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#pragma comment ( lib, "Shlwapi.lib" )}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#ifdef \_DEBUG}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#pragma comment ( lib, "benchmarkd.lib" )}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#else}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#pragma comment ( lib, "benchmark.lib" )}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#endif}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#endif}
\end{DoxyCode}


Can also use the graphical version of C\+Make\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open {\ttfamily C\+Make G\+UI}.
\item Under {\ttfamily Where to build the binaries}, same path as source plus {\ttfamily build}.
\item Under {\ttfamily C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+F\+IX}, same path as source plus {\ttfamily install}.
\item Click {\ttfamily Configure}, {\ttfamily Generate}, {\ttfamily Open Project}.
\item If build fails, try deleting entire directory and starting again, or unticking options to build less.

See instructions for building with Visual Studio. Once built, right click on the solution and change the build to Intel.\hypertarget{md__home_mary_VegaProgramEngineering_2024_build__deps_googlebenchmark-src_docs_platform_specific_build_instructions_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{Building on Solaris}\label{md__home_mary_VegaProgramEngineering_2024_build__deps_googlebenchmark-src_docs_platform_specific_build_instructions_autotoc_md19}
If you\textquotesingle{}re running benchmarks on solaris, you\textquotesingle{}ll want the kstat library linked in too ({\ttfamily -\/lkstat}).
