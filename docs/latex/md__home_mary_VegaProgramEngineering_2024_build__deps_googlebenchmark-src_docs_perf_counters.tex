When running benchmarks, the user may choose to request collection of performance counters. This may be useful in investigation scenarios -\/ narrowing down the cause of a regression; or verifying that the underlying cause of a performance improvement matches expectations.

This feature is available if\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The benchmark is run on an architecture featuring a Performance Monitoring Unit (P\+MU),
\item The benchmark is compiled with support for collecting counters. Currently, this requires \href{http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/}{\texttt{ libpfm}} be available at build time
\end{DoxyItemize}

The feature does not require modifying benchmark code. \mbox{\hyperlink{classCounter}{Counter}} collection is handled at the boundaries where timer collection is also handled.

To opt-\/in\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install {\ttfamily libpfm4-\/dev}, e.\+g. {\ttfamily apt-\/get install libpfm4-\/dev}.
\item Enable the cmake flag B\+E\+N\+C\+H\+M\+A\+R\+K\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+P\+FM.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To use, pass a comma-\/separated list of counter names through the {\ttfamily -\/-\/benchmark\+\_\+perf\+\_\+counters} flag. The names are decoded through libpfm -\/ meaning, they are platform specific, but some (e.\+g. {\ttfamily C\+Y\+C\+L\+ES} or {\ttfamily I\+N\+S\+T\+R\+U\+C\+T\+I\+O\+NS}) are mapped by libpfm to platform-\/specifics -\/ see libpfm \href{http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/docs.html}{\texttt{ documentation}} for more details.

The counter values are reported back through the \href{../README.md\#custom-counters}{\texttt{ User Counters}} mechanism, meaning, they are available in all the formats (e.\+g. J\+S\+ON) supported by User Counters.
