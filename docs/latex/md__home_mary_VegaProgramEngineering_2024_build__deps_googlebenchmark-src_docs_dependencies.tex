To ensure the broadest compatibility when building the benchmark library, but still allow forward progress, we require any build tooling to be available for\+:

\item Debian stable {\itshape and}
\item The last two Ubuntu L\+TS releases
\end{DoxyItemize}

Currently, this means using build tool versions that are available for Ubuntu 18.\+04 (Bionic Beaver), Ubuntu 20.\+04 (Focal Fossa), and Debian 11 (bullseye).

{\itshape Note, CI also runs ubuntu-\/16.\+04 and ubuntu-\/14.\+04 to ensure best effort support for older versions.}\hypertarget{md__home_mary_VegaProgramEngineering_2024_build__deps_googlebenchmark-src_docs_dependencies_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{cmake}\label{md__home_mary_VegaProgramEngineering_2024_build__deps_googlebenchmark-src_docs_dependencies_autotoc_md12}
The current supported version is cmake 3.\+5.\+1 as of 2018-\/06-\/06.

{\itshape Note, this version is also available for Ubuntu 14.\+04, an older Ubuntu L\+TS release, as {\ttfamily cmake3}.}
